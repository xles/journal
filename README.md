journal
=======

The UNIX user's personal log and diary.

## About

The `journal` project is (will be) a proper command line utility for
UNIX systems to produce static HTML weblogs (aka "_blogs_").

## Installation

**Don't** even try, it's not even finished yet.

### Prerequistites

* A UNIX system, such as FreeBSD or OS X (probably works in various
  flavours of linux too, I haven't tested).

* `gmake` because it's ubiquitus and I have some foo in the `Makefile`
  that isn't cross-make compatible right now.  I'll fix it, I promise.

* A decent compiler.  I recommend `clang` from `llvm`, but it probably
  compiles under `gcc` or BSD `cc` just fine.

## Usage

To be determined.  It will probably be something along the lines of:

```
usage: journal [-options] <command> [<argument>, ...]
```
